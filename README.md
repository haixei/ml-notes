# ðŸ“” Data Science Notes
In this repository I save notes on different topics that I've learned about in the past. I want this repository to be an useful place for people who both start with programming and are a little bit further in already. The data structures and algorithms folders are mostly showcasing the basic concepts. Ones related to math and machine learning explain univeristy level concepts. Every folder is a category and each of them should contain files in the md extension. All notes are created based on papers, articles and documentation that will be linked at the end of the file. All illustrations are my own.

_Note: The repository is updated every few days with exceptions._
